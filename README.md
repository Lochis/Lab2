# Lab2
    Is a lab from a College that I was given to practice with.

    Will not say which one and will not share with those that are in that College.

    Practicing promise chains, yargs, and the got command to get JSON data.
    Program takes in cli arguments --fname, --lname, and --prov to spit out the "earnings" based on a JSON repo.


    e.g. node lab2.js --fname Lucas --lname Vandermaarel --prov ON
    Console: 
  
    Lab 2
